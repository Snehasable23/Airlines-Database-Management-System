Airport Management System is a large scale project which includes database of more than a single Airport. This airline management system contains the details about: Airplane_Type, Route, Flight, Airfare, Passengers, Employees, Transactions, Countries and Airport.
The project has been planned to be having the view of distributed architecture, with centralized storage of the database.
The entire project has been developed keeping in view of the distributed client server computing technology, in mind. The specification has been normalized up to 2NF to eliminate all the anomalies that may arise due to the database transaction that are executed by the general users and the organizational administration. The user interfaces are browser specific to give distributed accessibility for the overall system.
Database management system helps making data more efficient and effective. This system stores, organises and manages a large amount of information within a single software application. Our Project on airline database system holds flight details, flight schedule, passenger details, ticket records, etc. We have used SQL as an language for applying queries. (Queries for insertion, deletion, updating, etc.)
